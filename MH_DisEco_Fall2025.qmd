This is a picture of a disease ecology triangle. It shows the relationship between host, pathogen and environment. So far we have seen how each of these ideas come together and represent disease ecology. The host can contain a pathogen which also is impacted by environment. That being said, the environment can impact characteristics of the pathogen and also the host. They all come together to represent a cohesive understanding of disease.

1.	MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (3 points)
FALSE. It is not primarily contained in humans. Its reservoir host is camels.  Human-Human transmission can occur when in close contact. According to the evidence, there isn’t sustained transmission in human species. 
2.	Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. It is in camels in the middle east/Africa, and the virus circulates through them. It can sometimes spillover to humans, but it is the camels that are the main reservoirs. Camels maintain the virus in the population for an elongated period of time.
3.	Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. Humans are dead end hosts because the transmission is limited and is not sustained within the population. Although secondary infection/transmission and spill over occur, it isn’t sustained.
4.	The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (3 points)
FALSE. The information above says 35% of reported MERS cases have died, not 65%. Case fatality corresponds to the amount of people who die specifically from a disease.
5.	The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. (3 points)
FALSE. There are multiple peaks over time. This means outbreaks are not from a single source point and can come from various environments such as sporadic areas or health care. Based on the look of the graph, it could represent a zoonotic spillover event. It could also be from multiple exposure events, and not just single exposure.

6.	Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend.    (5 points)
There are many factors that could cause this decline. Ecologically, there could be a reduction in contact between humans and infected camel. The decreased contact can be from travel, movement/trade of camel, or changes in travel trends. Behaviorally, there may have been changes due to the COVID-19 strain. People started taking precautions such as mask-wearing, increased sanitation, and human-human isolation. There was also a decrease in trave due to the bans many countries/areas put on. Epidemiologically, health care systems worked to prevent secondary outbreaks. There was also a rise in infection control awareness.

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwandaprobably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruitbats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases ofMarburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were healthcare workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

The Marburg Virus would be considered a spillover event under this frame work. According to the framework, disease emergence is a continuum. This means a spillover event from wildlife can become a human transmission/sustained event. We have seen in the past that direct exposure to bats can lead to human infection. With Egyptian fruit bats, human infection occurs from direct exposure of bat secretion or primates. This means there is limited human to human transmission. It is self-limiting and therefore does not promote human infection from pathogens that adapt. Overall, I would classify this as a zoonotic spillover instead of infectious disease emergence. If it was emergence of infectious disease, we would need to see sustained human-to-human transmission in the human population.

2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings? 5 pointsRecommended reading: Marburg Virus Disease in Rwanda – Centering Both Evidenceand Equity by Cameron T. Nutt (Canvas > Files > Readings)

There are many measures that can be implemented to reduce transmission. Early identification and isolation can be extremely beneficial. By reporting cases early and going into immediate isolation, it can reduce the spread. Another example would be to promote practices where there is safe burial/handling of fluids which can contain the spread within a community. Public and community education can also help raise awareness. By spreading information on awareness and prevention, numbers of cases can die down. An example of this would be to education communities on where the wildlife is that causes/transmits the disease. There can also be infectious control/training protocols in healthcare setting that can aid those with the infection. Even just by training, monitoring, isolating, and having good hygeine in the healthcare setting, a population could see a decreased risk of transmission.

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventative measures recommended by each setting. 

The transmission and prevention are different in Malaysia and Bangladesh. In Malaysia, the mode of transmission is typically through pigs. Specifically, fruitbats contaminated the pigs which were then given to humans. Human infection was due to contact with the pigs, so it was seen in a lot of farmers. It was also found that human-to-human transmission was very minimal and basically nonexistent. For prevention in Malaysia, they looked at interrupting the bat->pig-> human transmission chain. They focused on pig biosecurity. Some examples include moving fruit trees away from pig stables so the pig feed would not be contaminated by the bats. Also things like PPE, hygiene, and surveillance was done to help prevent more cases. In this situation, it is helpful for prevention to be at the livestock level since pigs are the major host. 

In Bangladesh, the primary route of transmission was from fruitbats to humans in a spillover event. The carrier of the disease was date palm sap that was contaminated by bats and sequentially consumed by humans. It then became frequent for human to human transmission. It was found in respiratory droplets, making it human to human. For the prevention of this disease, they looked at stopping the transmission of bats to humans and human to human. They used bamboo skirts to prevent the bat from interacting/licking the sap and contaminating it. They made public health announcements about consuming raw palm sap. There was also emphasis placed on hygiene and PPE for caregivers/healthcare and also isolation of people with the disease. In this situation, it is important for preventative measures to be taken for contaminated foods and human contact because the spillover is directly from bats and there is a lot of human to human transmission.

Avian reovirus (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristic supports one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly its impact on the affected population.

There are a few routes of transmission for ARV. For horizontal transmission, there is fecal-oral route, respiratory transmission, direct contact, and fomites. There is also an example of vertical transmission: Breeder hens that become infected can pass it directly to embryos. Although these are all possible for transmission, certain environments favor different types of transmission. With fecal-oral transmission, the virus survives and thrives in areas of poor sanitation and organic load. In general moist and cool environments are helpful for most of the modes of transmission. For fecal-oral and respiratory, environments like overcrowding and high population are good for the virus to spread. Also with the respiratory, poor ventilation promotes transmission. There are also pathogen characteristics that support transmission. This virus is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus. This virus is stable in the environment and is resistant to a lot of extremes due to its non enveloped character. This can help with fecal-oral transmission because it allows the virus to live in harsh conditions and live a long time outside of the primary host. An example of a wild bird disease caused by AVR is tenosynovitis in turkeys. This disease can cause inflammation, swollen joints, reduced mobility, and lameness.

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spill over and not a potential EID?

Based on what we know, the likely reservoir is shrew. The evidence that backed this claim up included high LayV detection in the shrews in comparison to other animals. Not only was it detected, but it was able to circulate the virus in nature. The likely mode of transmission is a zoonotic spillover from shrews to humans. This could have occurred through direct contact, indirect contact (fecal/urine/saliva), and possible contamination of food or other surfaces. There are many reasons as to why layV is not considered a potential EID. For one, there is no ongoing human-human transmission and all detected cases were considered sporadic. Not only this, but the amount of cases is very low and found in small rural areas. There is a small number of cases and there was also no evidence found of increasing cases or incidence. Since there are no sustained modes/chains of transmission with humans and human infection only occurs when in contact with the natural reservoir, one can assume this is a spillover.

Analysis/Explanation:
There are many trends and patterns that can be found when looking at this data. The first thing I did was look at differences in regions. The North region contained significantly lower prevalence compared to South and Central. This could occur for many reasons. For one, there may be a difference in raccoon density in these areas which affects egg transmission and fecal contamination. Considering there are different regions, a difference in temperature and humidity might impact survivability of the eggs. Also behavioral patterns may differ in the north, leading to less transmission/contact which is needed for infections to occur. Although there were some differences, the intensity rate stayed very similar in the 3 regions. Although a region may have more events including exposure, the worms that cause infection have around the same impact on each region. The p value was significant at 0.0016 since it's less than 0.05. 

The next area I looked at was gender. I found that females have a higher prevalence than males. Some possible reasons for this include behavioral maternal instincts. Since females are typically in a “home range”, it could increase their exposure. I also found that females stay in dens longer, also increasing their risk to exposure and infection. The p value was 0.0087 which is statistically significant. 

I then looked at age-based differences. Adults presented with a higher prevalence than young adults. I think this is the case because adults have more time to accumulate infection which could lead to this result. Also, young adults are still trying to find their established territories which may reduce exposures. Although there are some patterns between the two ages, the P-value is 0.2212 which is not statistically significant. 

11/24/2025 --Memo
To: Iowa department of public health
From: Madeleine Hamborg FOWS 7200
Date: 11/24/2025
Subject: Health risks and recommended actions for Mpox
Purpose: 
This memo is meant to provide an overview of information regarding Mpox. This memo will look at detection, characterization, prevention, and next steps if cases were to appear. 
Natural reservoir: Mpox is a virus that is closely related to small pox. The natural reservoir is not 100% confirmed, but it is most strongly linked to rodents in Africa. Non-incidental hosts include non-human primates. The wildlife reservoirs enable long term viral persistence in the environment and temporal/periodic spillover to humans. 
Causative agent: Mpox is a double-stranded DNA virus found in the orthopoxvirus family. Mpox can be split up into Clade I (Central African//more severe) and Clade II (Western Africa). 
Transmission pathways: 
There are many ways in which Mpox can be transmitted. The first includes respiratory droplets from face-to-face exposure, contaminated fomites, and direct contact with body fluids. There can also be spillover events including human-to-human and animal-to-human (zoonotic). Animal-to-human can occur through scratches/ bites and handling infected animals. In contrast, human-to-human can occur from close physical contact, direct contact with body fluid/lesions, sexual contact, and contaminated surfaces.
Geographic distribution:
In the past, Mpox had been endemic to areas in west and central Africa. In 2022, an outbreak occurred across Europe and North America. There were 87,000 confirmed cases globally and driven by global travel, decreased immunity of smallpox, and human-rodent interactions. Areas with close contact communities and networks still occasionally report infections of Mpox. Cases have declined since 2022, but possible re-introduction to other regions is possible. 
Clinical presentation:
Some common symptoms include lethargy, chills, fever, headache, body aches, fatigue, and also a rash. The rash can be unique to an infection and may have pustules, scabs, and vesicles. The rash may present as localized or spread across multiple regions of the body. For those who have immuno deficiency, there can be secondary infections including pneumonia and encephalitis. 
Implications of risk with importing Mpox (Iowa):
A case coming into Iowa could pose several risks. Iowa has limited clinical exposure to Mpox, leaving them vulnerable to possible infection. The rash may be mistaken for various other infections due to its broad/vague characterization. There is also a risk of group transmission in communities and healthcare settings from close contact. Fomite spread may occur due to environmental persistence. Not only is this infection a risk to locals/populations, it can also impact healthcare workers due to possible direct exposure. There may be possible delayed cases in healthcare from indirect exposure as well. Ecologically, there is a possibility of spillback into US rodent populations. Due to Mpox’s broad host range, there is always a risk of a spillover event occurring which has the opportunity to infect the wildlife in Iowa. Iowa contains ecological analogues to the African rodents, which could theoretically support viral replication and infection if exposed. 

Actionable public health recommendations: 
Provider preparedness:
The use of PPE and handling contaminated materials safely
Hygienic sanitation and awareness of infection
Quick action on clinical recognition (e.g genital lesions)
Case management:
Immediate isolation of infected individuals
Contact tracing within 21 days
The use of antivirals
Surveillance:
Access to PCR testing
Require rapid reporting to IDPH
Increase testing/screening in facilities
Infection control: 
Require using N95 masks and proper PPE to reduce chance of transmission
Enforce contact and airborne procedures for those who may have Mpox
Community communication:
Give transparent and clear information on transmission to the public
Discourage practices including handling rodents
Disease ecology: 
Use preventative measures in environment to decrease risk of spillover events
Use trends from wildlife organizations to predict trends and various dynamics

Conclusion:
Mpox is considered a global public health concern because of its spread through human international travel patterns, human-to-human transmissions, and animal-to-human transmission (zoonotic). A reported case in Iowa could result in local/community spread of infection. It is important to use preventative measures to ensure no outbreak occurs. If able to properly manage disease ecology strategies, Iowa can minimize the risk of sustained transmission for both humans and animals.

1. There are some specific human behaviors that are practiced by poultry farmers that contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella. The first thing that can cause the spread is handling poultry without washing hands. Salmonella can reside in a bird’s feathers, beak, feet, and droppings. When backyard owners handle chickens and ducks, there is a risk of the bacteria being transferred from bird to human. Not washing hands can allow for residual bacteria on a human, potentially leading to ingestions and infection. Some examples include kissing or cuddling birds. Another possible risk is allowing poultry inside or near human living spaces. By allowing poultry in these areas, it increases the risk of contamination of surfaces used by humans. Especially children who touch their face/ingest lots of things, the contamination of human objects increases the risk of contracting salmonella. Another risk includes being in close contact/kissing, cuddling the birds. These types of behaviors lead to close contact of feathers to the face which increases oral exposure/ possible ingestion. All of these human errors can lead to contamination and contraction of salmonella



2a.There are some advantages to Tall Fescue becoming infected with a fungal endophyte. This fungus helps with drought and heat tolerance, allowing for survival in stressful conditions. It does this by enhancing water use and stress resistant measures. There is also an improved resistance to animal consumption. The ergot alkaloids make herbivores less prone to damage the plant. The last thing that is an advantage is the endophytes competitiveness. When infected with an endophyte, the plant establishes and outcompetes other species. This contributes to its longevity. 
2b.There are many environmental and ecological factors that drive occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis. In pastures, there is a high infection rate of endophytes. The large amount of endophytes sequentially increases alkaloid exposure for livestock that eat by grazing. Stressful conditions such as drought can also increase alkaloid production. There are also seasonal patterns for alkaloid concentrations. The peak of alkaloid production is in late spring and summer. Another factor could be grazing pressure and forage availability. The high consumption causes an increase in stems and toxins. There can be differences in expression of endophytes based on soil fertility and microbial communities. 
2c.Clinical signs and symptoms of cattle toxicity are normal when infected. Some signs include poor feed efficiency, decrease in weight, higher heat symptoms, and n issues with conceptions, and prolonged gestation. Some other related symptoms include immune system problems, lameness, and vasoconstriction. There are also some shifts in energy metabolism and decrease in energy availability. There is also fluctuation in stress response in decrease in cell integrity.
