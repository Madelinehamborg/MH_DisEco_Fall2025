Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

This is a picture of a disease ecology triangle. It shows the relationship between host, pathogen and environment. So far we have seen how each of these ideas come together and represent disease ecology. The host can contain a pathogen which also is impacted by environment. That being said, the environment can impact characteristics of the pathogen and also the host. They all come together to represent a cohesive understanding of disease.

Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

59

Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

299 samples

\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

228 samples

You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%

10/07/2025-- Try 2
a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)

6/12/25=>New cases:5 so susceptible= 56-1-4=51

incidence: 5/51=0.098=9.8% per day

6/14/25=> New cases:2 so susceptible=56-12=44

Incidence:2/44= 0.0455=4.6% per day

6/15/25=>New cases: 0 So susceptible=56-14=42

Incidence=0/42=0% per day

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 6/13/25 and 6/16/25? What is the unit for prevelance

6/13/25=> 12/56=0.214=21.4%

6/16/25=> 5/56=0.089=8.9%

The unit for incidence is % of population at a point in time.

The unit of prevelance is a percentage of infected/whole population.

C) On which day is the prevalence same as incidence (except the units)?

1/56=17.9% and 1/56=17.9% on 6/10/2025

d) On which day is incidence lowest?

6/15 and 6/16

6/15/25: 0/42=0 new cases

6/16/25=0/42 new cases

1.	MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (3 points)
FALSE. It is not primarily contained in humans. Its reservoir host is camels.  Human-Human transmission can occur when in close contact. According to the evidence, there isn’t sustained transmission in human species. 
2.	Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. It is in camels in the middle east/Africa, and the virus circulates through them. It can sometimes spillover to humans, but it is the camels that are the main reservoirs. Camels maintain the virus in the population for an elongated period of time.
3.	Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. Humans are dead end hosts because the transmission is limited and is not sustained within the population. Although secondary infection/transmission and spill over occur, it isn’t sustained.
4.	The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (3 points)
FALSE. The information above says 35% of reported MERS cases have died, not 65%. Case fatality corresponds to the amount of people who die specifically from a disease.
5.	The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. (3 points)
FALSE. There are multiple peaks over time. This means outbreaks are not from a single source point and can come from various environments such as sporadic areas or health care. Based on the look of the graph, it could represent a zoonotic spillover event. It could also be from multiple exposure events, and not just single exposure.

6.	Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend.    (5 points)
There are many factors that could cause this decline. Ecologically, there could be a reduction in contact between humans and infected camel. The decreased contact can be from travel, movement/trade of camel, or changes in travel trends. Behaviorally, there may have been changes due to the COVID-19 strain. People started taking precautions such as mask-wearing, increased sanitation, and human-human isolation. There was also a decrease in trave due to the bans many countries/areas put on. Epidemiologically, health care systems worked to prevent secondary outbreaks. There was also a rise in infection control awareness.
