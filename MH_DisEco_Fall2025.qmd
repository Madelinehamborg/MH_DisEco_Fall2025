This is a picture of a disease ecology triangle. It shows the relationship between host, pathogen and environment. So far we have seen how each of these ideas come together and represent disease ecology. The host can contain a pathogen which also is impacted by environment. That being said, the environment can impact characteristics of the pathogen and also the host. They all come together to represent a cohesive understanding of disease.

1.	MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (3 points)
FALSE. It is not primarily contained in humans. Its reservoir host is camels.  Human-Human transmission can occur when in close contact. According to the evidence, there isn’t sustained transmission in human species. 
2.	Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. It is in camels in the middle east/Africa, and the virus circulates through them. It can sometimes spillover to humans, but it is the camels that are the main reservoirs. Camels maintain the virus in the population for an elongated period of time.
3.	Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. Humans are dead end hosts because the transmission is limited and is not sustained within the population. Although secondary infection/transmission and spill over occur, it isn’t sustained.
4.	The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (3 points)
FALSE. The information above says 35% of reported MERS cases have died, not 65%. Case fatality corresponds to the amount of people who die specifically from a disease.
5.	The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. (3 points)
FALSE. There are multiple peaks over time. This means outbreaks are not from a single source point and can come from various environments such as sporadic areas or health care. Based on the look of the graph, it could represent a zoonotic spillover event. It could also be from multiple exposure events, and not just single exposure.

6.	Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend.    (5 points)
There are many factors that could cause this decline. Ecologically, there could be a reduction in contact between humans and infected camel. The decreased contact can be from travel, movement/trade of camel, or changes in travel trends. Behaviorally, there may have been changes due to the COVID-19 strain. People started taking precautions such as mask-wearing, increased sanitation, and human-human isolation. There was also a decrease in trave due to the bans many countries/areas put on. Epidemiologically, health care systems worked to prevent secondary outbreaks. There was also a rise in infection control awareness.

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwandaprobably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruitbats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases ofMarburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were healthcare workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

The Marburg Virus would be considered a spillover event under this frame work. According to the framework, disease emergence is a continuum. This means a spillover event from wildlife can become a human transmission/sustained event. We have seen in the past that direct exposure to bats can lead to human infection. With Egyptian fruit bats, human infection occurs from direct exposure of bat secretion or primates. This means there is limited human to human transmission. It is self-limiting and therefore does not promote human infection from pathogens that adapt. Overall, I would classify this as a zoonotic spillover instead of infectious disease emergence. If it was emergence of infectious disease, we would need to see sustained human-to-human transmission in the human population.

2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings? 5 pointsRecommended reading: Marburg Virus Disease in Rwanda – Centering Both Evidenceand Equity by Cameron T. Nutt (Canvas > Files > Readings)

There are many measures that can be implemented to reduce transmission. Early identification and isolation can be extremely beneficial. By reporting cases early and going into immediate isolation, it can reduce the spread. Another example would be to promote practices where there is safe burial/handling of fluids which can contain the spread within a community. Public and community education can also help raise awareness. By spreading information on awareness and prevention, numbers of cases can die down. An example of this would be to education communities on where the wildlife is that causes/transmits the disease. There can also be infectious control/training protocols in healthcare setting that can aid those with the infection. Even just by training, monitoring, isolating, and having good hygeine in the healthcare setting, a population could see a decreased risk of transmission.

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventative measures recommended by each setting. 

The transmission and prevention are different in Malaysia and Bangladesh. In Malaysia, the mode of transmission is typically through pigs. Specifically, fruitbats contaminated the pigs which were then given to humans. Human infection was due to contact with the pigs, so it was seen in a lot of farmers. It was also found that human-to-human transmission was very minimal and basically nonexistent. For prevention in Malaysia, they looked at interrupting the bat->pig-> human transmission chain. They focused on pig biosecurity. Some examples include moving fruit trees away from pig stables so the pig feed would not be contaminated by the bats. Also things like PPE, hygiene, and surveillance was done to help prevent more cases. In this situation, it is helpful for prevention to be at the livestock level since pigs are the major host. 

In Bangladesh, the primary route of transmission was from fruitbats to humans in a spillover event. The carrier of the disease was date palm sap that was contaminated by bats and sequentially consumed by humans. It then became frequent for human to human transmission. It was found in respiratory droplets, making it human to human. For the prevention of this disease, they looked at stopping the transmission of bats to humans and human to human. They used bamboo skirts to prevent the bat from interacting/licking the sap and contaminating it. They made public health announcements about consuming raw palm sap. There was also emphasis placed on hygiene and PPE for caregivers/healthcare and also isolation of people with the disease. In this situation, it is important for preventative measures to be taken for contaminated foods and human contact because the spillover is directly from bats and there is a lot of human to human transmission.

Avian reovirus (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristic supports one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly its impact on the affected population.

There are a few routes of transmission for ARV. For horizontal transmission, there is fecal-oral route, respiratory transmission, direct contact, and fomites. There is also an example of vertical transmission: Breeder hens that become infected can pass it directly to embryos. Although these are all possible for transmission, certain environments favor different types of transmission. With fecal-oral transmission, the virus survives and thrives in areas of poor sanitation and organic load. In general moist and cool environments are helpful for most of the modes of transmission. For fecal-oral and respiratory, environments like overcrowding and high population are good for the virus to spread. Also with the respiratory, poor ventilation promotes transmission. There are also pathogen characteristics that support transmission. This virus is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus. This virus is stable in the environment and is resistant to a lot of extremes due to its non enveloped character. This can help with fecal-oral transmission because it allows the virus to live in harsh conditions and live a long time outside of the primary host. An example of a wild bird disease caused by AVR is tenosynovitis in turkeys. This disease can cause inflammation, swollen joints, reduced mobility, and lameness.

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spill over and not a potential EID?

Based on what we know, the likely reservoir is shrew. The evidence that backed this claim up included high LayV detection in the shrews in comparison to other animals. Not only was it detected, but it was able to circulate the virus in nature. The likely mode of transmission is a zoonotic spillover from shrews to humans. This could have occurred through direct contact, indirect contact (fecal/urine/saliva), and possible contamination of food or other surfaces. There are many reasons as to why layV is not considered a potential EID. For one, there is no ongoing human-human transmission and all detected cases were considered sporadic. Not only this, but the amount of cases is very low and found in small rural areas. There is a small number of cases and there was also no evidence found of increasing cases or incidence. Since there are no sustained modes/chains of transmission with humans and human infection only occurs when in contact with the natural reservoir, one can assume this is a spillover.

Analysis/Explanation:
There are many trends and patterns that can be found when looking at this data. The first thing I did was look at differences in regions. The North region contained significantly lower prevalence compared to South and Central. This could occur for many reasons. For one, there may be a difference in raccoon density in these areas which affects egg transmission and fecal contamination. Considering there are different regions, a difference in temperature and humidity might impact survivability of the eggs. Also behavioral patterns may differ in the north, leading to less transmission/contact which is needed for infections to occur. Although there were some differences, the intensity rate stayed very similar in the 3 regions. Although a region may have more events including exposure, the worms that cause infection have around the same impact on each region. The p value was significant at 0.0016 since it's less than 0.05. 

The next area I looked at was gender. I found that females have a higher prevalence than males. Some possible reasons for this include behavioral maternal instincts. Since females are typically in a “home range”, it could increase their exposure. I also found that females stay in dens longer, also increasing their risk to exposure and infection. The p value was 0.0087 which is statistically significant. 

I then looked at age-based differences. Adults presented with a higher prevalence than young adults. I think this is the case because adults have more time to accumulate infection which could lead to this result. Also, young adults are still trying to find their established territories which may reduce exposures. Although there are some patterns between the two ages, the P-value is 0.2212 which is not statistically significant. 

11/24/2025 --Memo
To: Iowa department of public health
From: Madeleine Hamborg FOWS 7200
Date: 11/24/2025
Subject: Health risks and recommended actions for Mpox
Purpose: 
This memo is meant to provide an overview of information regarding Mpox. This memo will look at detection, characterization, prevention, and next steps if cases were to appear. 
Natural reservoir: Mpox is a virus that is closely related to small pox. The natural reservoir is not 100% confirmed, but it is most strongly linked to rodents in Africa. Non-incidental hosts include non-human primates. The wildlife reservoirs enable long term viral persistence in the environment and temporal/periodic spillover to humans. 
Causative agent: Mpox is a double-stranded DNA virus found in the orthopoxvirus family. Mpox can be split up into Clade I (Central African//more severe) and Clade II (Western Africa). 
Transmission pathways: 
There are many ways in which Mpox can be transmitted. The first includes respiratory droplets from face-to-face exposure, contaminated fomites, and direct contact with body fluids. There can also be spillover events including human-to-human and animal-to-human (zoonotic). Animal-to-human can occur through scratches/ bites and handling infected animals. In contrast, human-to-human can occur from close physical contact, direct contact with body fluid/lesions, sexual contact, and contaminated surfaces.
Geographic distribution:
In the past, Mpox had been endemic to areas in west and central Africa. In 2022, an outbreak occurred across Europe and North America. There were 87,000 confirmed cases globally and driven by global travel, decreased immunity of smallpox, and human-rodent interactions. Areas with close contact communities and networks still occasionally report infections of Mpox. Cases have declined since 2022, but possible re-introduction to other regions is possible. 
Clinical presentation:
Some common symptoms include lethargy, chills, fever, headache, body aches, fatigue, and also a rash. The rash can be unique to an infection and may have pustules, scabs, and vesicles. The rash may present as localized or spread across multiple regions of the body. For those who have immuno deficiency, there can be secondary infections including pneumonia and encephalitis. 
Implications of risk with importing Mpox (Iowa):
A case coming into Iowa could pose several risks. Iowa has limited clinical exposure to Mpox, leaving them vulnerable to possible infection. The rash may be mistaken for various other infections due to its broad/vague characterization. There is also a risk of group transmission in communities and healthcare settings from close contact. Fomite spread may occur due to environmental persistence. Not only is this infection a risk to locals/populations, it can also impact healthcare workers due to possible direct exposure. There may be possible delayed cases in healthcare from indirect exposure as well. Ecologically, there is a possibility of spillback into US rodent populations. Due to Mpox’s broad host range, there is always a risk of a spillover event occurring which has the opportunity to infect the wildlife in Iowa. Iowa contains ecological analogues to the African rodents, which could theoretically support viral replication and infection if exposed. 

Actionable public health recommendations: 
Provider preparedness:
The use of PPE and handling contaminated materials safely
Hygienic sanitation and awareness of infection
Quick action on clinical recognition (e.g genital lesions)
Case management:
Immediate isolation of infected individuals
Contact tracing within 21 days
The use of antivirals
Surveillance:
Access to PCR testing
Require rapid reporting to IDPH
Increase testing/screening in facilities
Infection control: 
Require using N95 masks and proper PPE to reduce chance of transmission
Enforce contact and airborne procedures for those who may have Mpox
Community communication:
Give transparent and clear information on transmission to the public
Discourage practices including handling rodents
Disease ecology: 
Use preventative measures in environment to decrease risk of spillover events
Use trends from wildlife organizations to predict trends and various dynamics

Conclusion:
Mpox is considered a global public health concern because of its spread through human international travel patterns, human-to-human transmissions, and animal-to-human transmission (zoonotic). A reported case in Iowa could result in local/community spread of infection. It is important to use preventative measures to ensure no outbreak occurs. If able to properly manage disease ecology strategies, Iowa can minimize the risk of sustained transmission for both humans and animals.

1. There are some specific human behaviors that are practiced by poultry farmers that contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella. The first thing that can cause the spread is handling poultry without washing hands. Salmonella can reside in a bird’s feathers, beak, feet, and droppings. When backyard owners handle chickens and ducks, there is a risk of the bacteria being transferred from bird to human. Not washing hands can allow for residual bacteria on a human, potentially leading to ingestions and infection. Some examples include kissing or cuddling birds. Another possible risk is allowing poultry inside or near human living spaces. By allowing poultry in these areas, it increases the risk of contamination of surfaces used by humans. Especially children who touch their face/ingest lots of things, the contamination of human objects increases the risk of contracting salmonella. Another risk includes being in close contact/kissing, cuddling the birds. These types of behaviors lead to close contact of feathers to the face which increases oral exposure/ possible ingestion. All of these human errors can lead to contamination and contraction of salmonella



2a.There are some advantages to Tall Fescue becoming infected with a fungal endophyte. This fungus helps with drought and heat tolerance, allowing for survival in stressful conditions. It does this by enhancing water use and stress resistant measures. There is also an improved resistance to animal consumption. The ergot alkaloids make herbivores less prone to damage the plant. The last thing that is an advantage is the endophytes competitiveness. When infected with an endophyte, the plant establishes and outcompetes other species. This contributes to its longevity. 
2b.There are many environmental and ecological factors that drive occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis. In pastures, there is a high infection rate of endophytes. The large amount of endophytes sequentially increases alkaloid exposure for livestock that eat by grazing. Stressful conditions such as drought can also increase alkaloid production. There are also seasonal patterns for alkaloid concentrations. The peak of alkaloid production is in late spring and summer. Another factor could be grazing pressure and forage availability. The high consumption causes an increase in stems and toxins. There can be differences in expression of endophytes based on soil fertility and microbial communities. 
2c.Clinical signs and symptoms of cattle toxicity are normal when infected. Some signs include poor feed efficiency, decrease in weight, higher heat symptoms, and n issues with conceptions, and prolonged gestation. Some other related symptoms include immune system problems, lameness, and vasoconstriction. There are also some shifts in energy metabolism and decrease in energy availability. There is also fluctuation in stress response in decrease in cell integrity.

1. There are different routes of transmission for African swine fever. There is direct transmission and vector borne. There can be pig to pig transmission from saliva, secretions, urine/fecal matter, and predominantly blood. This mode is highly efficient because ASFV comes in high titers in the blood. Indirectly, it can be transmitted by fomites which contaminate materials and counters. It is known to be resistant to a lot of disinfectants, which contribute to its infectivity. ASFV can also be transmitted through food and eating contaminated pork. Not only that, but swill feeding can cause major global health issues as well. This virus is also vector born through ornithodoros/ticks. This is done by a sylvatic cycle in which it circulates. This circulation causes ticks to be a major and natural reservoir. Ticks serve as reservoirs and vectors in parts of Europe and Africa. Carcasses can also be infected and contact with it in any capacity can cause contraction. The virus can also persist for months in a carcass, also making it a possible mode of transmission. Another mode of transmission for human spread is pig movement, contaminated equipment, pork products, and illegal swill feeding. Human work as a mechanical vector by moving contaminated sources. Interestingly, the virus can survive around 30 days. Some examples of people who may move this virus include vets, farmers, and transporters.

2.A coinfection with KoRV affects the severity, progression, and management of chlamydia. This infection decreased the koala population by 30% between 2018 and 2021. Things like environmental stressors, habitat fragmentation, and climate change increase the production of the stress hormone. KoRV-B affects the immune system and when coinfected with chlamydia, makes cases more severe. The chlamydia is in a higher bacterial load due to the lack of immune function these koalas contain. The lack of immune function allows the chlamydia itself and the chlamydia symptoms to become more aggressive. This can include severe infertility, worse conjunctivitis, and other reproductive issues. Mechanistically, KoRV-B integrates into host immune cells which alter cytokine expression. In terms of disease progression, most koalas have faster progression of chlamydia if they are co-diagnosed with KoRV-B. The disease may also progress to a more systemic case. KoRV-B makes it progress quicker by causing immune dysregulation that resembles retroviral infections and accelerating the pathogen lifecycle/replication. In terms of management, KoRV-B makes it hard to treat and manage chlamydia. It does this by reducing treatment success, more need for care, complications with immune response, and issues with implications. Antibiotics become less helpful because the immune system is already having problems. If a koala has a coinfection of KoRV-B and chlamydia, medical attention is needed including fluids, hospitalization, pain control, etc. Another big aspect is that there is no effective anti-viral treatment for KoRV-B.

3.SFD is caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola which impacts wild snake populations.There are many challenges with surveillance and management of SFD. One issue is that the fungus persists in soil, decaying leaves, and debris from wood. This curates a long term reservoir in which snakes interact with. Many snakes show minimal or broad ranging symptoms that may be mistaken for other infections. The inability to diagnose early due to the vague symptoms makes researchers underestimate prevalence. Snakes have a seasonal pattern which means they are not active at certain times. In these patterns, there is a hibernation period where there is immunosuppression of snakes. The O. ophiodiicola can persist in soils which make it even harder to eliminate. Some reservoirs in the environment can also help to sustain transmission. There is a lot of variation and severity differences across species which makes it hard to quantify data accurately. There are also diagnostic issues including expensive qPCRS that may have false negatives due to the low amount of fungus that could appear on the snake. There is also a lack of funding, issues with captivity, and overlapping symptoms with other diseases that can cause challenges in surveying and management. Overall, management issues can arise from low detectability, diagnostic limitations, seasonal immunosuppression and issues with monitoring infection.

Disease Ecology Final 
1. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect (10 points) 
a. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen  (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and  not within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover. 
True
b. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious. 
False: Vectors are things like mosquitoes and ticks. They are infectious but are not contagious.Contagious is when disease is transmitted directly from host to host. Vector borne disease such as the one mentioned lacks direct transmission from infected to infected, making it infectious but not contagious. 
c. The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct  contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon. 
False:  Raccoon roundworms are not immediately infected post shedding. They must embryonate for 2-4 weeks in the environment in order to become infectious. The eggs are shed in raccoon feces and become infectious once they develop in environments, which can take between 18 days to several weeks. This means that direct contact immediately after would not result in infection. According to Lec 15, these eggs accumulate at latrine sites and can be infective for up to 6 years.
d. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in  cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production. 
False: The fungus itself is not responsible for reduced feed intake or reduced milk production. The endophytic fungus produces toxic ergot alkaloids which cause fescue toxicoses. This leads to the decreased feed intake, reduced weight gain, and lower milk production.
e. Northern cardinals are considered a superspreader species for West Nile virus.
False: They are not superspreaders. The Northern Cardinal is a supersuppressor. It fails to amplify the transmission and is not as competent as a host for west nile. According to Lecture 16, culex shifted to feeding on Northern cardinals in July-August, ultimately decreasing human risk in Atlanta GA. The American Robin is known as the superspreader. It is a migratory bird in which mosquitos feed on in the early half of season (June). Because Robins are asymptomatic, they are considered superspreaders of WNV. It is also known that avian viremia levels are high in August-September which is a window of infectivity.
2. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis  transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific  stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)
According to Lecture 11, there are a few ways to intervene on dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Although there is no treatment or vaccination, it is in the process of becoming eradicated. In terms of intervention, we must disrupt the transmission cycle. One way is by filtering water. The water contains water fleas with the larvae in it. We can also focus on providing incentives for those who are infected to not contaminate the water sources which would continue infection. There are also larvicides which can kill the copepods and break transmission cycles. 
The preventative measures intervene on specific stages of the guinea worm life cycle. By using mesh cloth or other filters, it can stop humans from ingesting copepods infected with Dracunculus by removing the crustacean physically from the water. Without the consumption of the copepods, the parasite cannot enter and develop within the human host, breaking the cycle. As previously mentioned, larvicide is also a known intervention. This treatment is for contaminated water, and works to reduce or delete the intermediate host which is the infected copepod. This breaks the cycle between the water and humans. Some common themes we have mentioned in this class are health education and surveillance/case detection. These practices can be done as well by preventing infected people from entering shared water sources and encouraging reporting. If they are able to detect contamination early, they can prevent a female worm from releasing its larvae which would prevent the whole parasitic life cycle from occurring. 
Lecture 11 talks about the emergence in dogs as well. It was found that cases tend to spike during summer and that the dogs are free roaming. Strategies evolved for cases specifically to dogs. Some strategies include keeping dogs out of water sources and preventing them from eating possible contaminated fish entrails. These can help prevent more transmission and infection of this parasite.




3. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)

There are many obstacles wildlife agencies face when managing/controlling CWD. According to lecture 11, CWD is caused by misfolded proteins called prions. These spread and mutate through the body. They spread through the nervous system of deer, with concentrations higher in specific regions. CWD is spread through direct contact from deer to deer and also indirectly. Indirectly, prions can reside in soils that become contaminated by carcasses and bodily fluids.  Prions are unique in that they can remain in the environment and stay infectious for years after. Interestingly, the infections have an incubation period of 1 ½ -3 years post-exposure. The deer may appear normal, leading to more contaminations and infections. Some signs of CWD include weight loss, weird behavior, and sometimes death.  

Based on this information, there are many challenges when trying to control CWD. The long incubation and pre-symptom shedding allows infection to reside for a long time before clinical signs appear. This makes it difficult to obtain early detection and removal of the CWD. The environmental persistence of the prions also creates challenges for maintenance because it is hard to decontaminate long-term reservoirs. Although there is testing that can be done to look for CWD, testing of live deer has been proven to be challenging, due to the high mobility and dispersal of deer. There is also human-mediated spread. Things like moving carcasses, contaminated equipment, and processed venison can cause the spread of CWD. 
4. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with Mycobacterium leprae. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population: 
• March 2025: 3 infected 
• April 2025: 5 infected 
• May 2025: 5 infected 
• June 2025: 8 infected 
• July 2025: 13 infected 
(No deaths, births, immigration, or recovery occurred during the study.) 
a. Calculate the monthly incidence of M. leprae infection. Show your calculations and state the units.  
(5 points) 
March 2025: 3/60= 0.05 cases per armadillo-month
April 2025: 5-3= 2/57=0.035 cases per armadillo-month
May 2025: 5-5=0    0/55=0 cases per armadillo-month
June 2025: 8-5=3   3/55=0.055 cases per armadillo-month 
July 2025: 13-8=5  5/52= 0.096 cases per armadillo-month

b. Which month had the highest prevalence? Which month had the lowest prevalence? Show your calculations and state the units. (5 points) 

March 2025: 3 infected/60 total= 5%
April 2025: 5 infected/60 total=8.3%
May 2025: 5 infected/60 total= 8.3%
June 2025: 8 infected/60 total=13.3%
July 2025: 13 infected/60 total=21.7%

The highest prevalence is in the month of July at 21.7% and the lowest is in March at 5%.




5. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia. 
a. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points) 
Based on lecture 19.2, Tularemia is a zoonotic infection caused by Francisella tularensis. Specifically, the aquatic cycle type B subspecies holartica. For this one, beavers are primary host for this pathogen. Type B is commonly associated with waterborne outbreaks and infections in semiaquatic mammals
b. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points) 
There are a few routes of transmission. There is vector borne transmission from ticks (deer flies, lone star tick, american dog tick, and mosquitos). It can also be transmitted through direct contact of handling these mammals or their fluids or carcasses. It can also be ingested and inhaled for transmission. Drinking contaminated water and eating undercooked infected meat are two ways of ingesting. In terms of inhalation, aerosolized bacteria from contaminated soil and vegetation or during activities like landscaping. Overall, environmental exposure of contaminated water sources can cause a lot of these. There have been no reports of tularemia being spread from person to person. Some dead end hosts are humans, cats, and dogs.
c. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/ public health. (3 points)
According to lecture 19.2, this pathogen can disrupt the immune system and its components. It also has a very low infectious dose making it a significant public health concern. It is considered a category A  bioterrorism agent due to the aerosolization and environmental persistence. There are also variations in clinical presentation including ulceroglandular (skin), glandular (lymph nodes), oculoglandular (eye contamination), oropharyngeal (ingestion), pneumonic (inhalation), typhoid (systemic). In terms of type B strains, they can survive long periods in water, increasing the risk of transmission. Although there is no human to human transmission, there is a wide host range with frequent spillover to humans. Due to the low infectious dose (10-50 organisms) makes it a potential bioterrorism weapon.

8. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of ~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)
When using hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR is looking at if true CWD prevalence were at least 0.2%, what is the probability that we would still detect zero positives in a sample of 1351 animals? Because the probability is low (statistically), they choose to infer that CWD is not likely to surpass 0.2% prevalence. This logic is strong if the hypergeometric model holds. 
It is known that hunter-harvested deer are not a random sample of deer in the statewide population. Hunters disproportionately kill certain ages and sex of deer, hunt in known/popular hunting areas, and avoid other areas of kill. Private lands may also go unsampled, leading to the possibility of CWD spread without knowledge to public health officials. The hypogeometric approach makes it seem as if all 1351 deer were drawn evenly from all 1 million deer. In reality, there are many biases and other factors in this subset of the population.
It should also be known that test sensitivity is not perfect. There is a chance of false negatives due to early infections or sampling the wrong tissues. This is not only a problem in itself, but also increases the risk of missing infected animals beyond the model. Overall, the major downfall of hypogeometric reliance is that it can create a false sense of certainty. It is read as if “CWD is not present above 0.2%”, when instead it means that all of the other assumptions must be true and be confident at the 90-95% level. In an everyday normal wildlife system, there are many confounding variables like uneven sampling, imperfect tests, spatial clustering, population movement, environmental, and long incubation periods. These factors violate the assumptions of the hypogeometric methods. Although hypergeometric methods are useful for statistics/ planning, it is important to combine it with other forms of risk-based and surveillance methods.

10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers.  
(8 points)


Definitive host: The definitive host is marine mammals. This is because the parasite reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. It then releases eggs into the ocean via fecal matter.

Dead-end host: The dead-end host is humans. Humans can become infected by eating undercooked/raw fish that contain larvae in the L3 stage. Although humans can become infected, the parasite can’t reproduce or mature in humans, causing it to be a dead end host.

Paratenic host: Cephalopod and fish are paratenic hosts. These hosts maintain parasites without development of parasites. Its only role is to transport the parasite in the food chain. It does this by encysting into muscle tissue and waits to be eaten by a definitive host.

Intermediate host: The intermediate host is marine crustaceans. In this intermediate  host, the parasite will undergo a developmental stage. In this case, the eggs that hatch into larvae are eaten by crustaceans and they develop into an L2 stage.

11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points) 
This statement is incorrect. There can be situations in which something is infected but NOT diseased. Some infections can be asymptomatic, lacking disease characteristics. An example would be the meningeal worm that infects WTD but shows no symptoms. COVID-19 is also an example of this. A significant proportion of infected individuals show now symptoms but can still spread the infection.
12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV?  
 (3 points)
PDV is talked about in lecture 10. To find the amount that needs to be vaccinated, we use 1-1/Ro. So 1/2.5= 0.4 and 1-0.4=0.6. So, 60% of the seal population would need vaccination to prevent future outbreak.

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant 
examples. (6 points)

There are many challenges when it comes to managing wildlife diseases. For one, detecting disease in free ranging animals. Wild animals make it difficult to capture, sample, and observe the species. An example of this we talked about in class is CWD. Because of the long incubation period and the ability to shed prions for months to years, there is difficulty managing early detection and overall disease. Another challenge is the complex transmission ecology and multiple hosts/vectors. An example of this can come from lecture 15 and is the lifecycle of B. procyonis. It contains many hosts including raccoons and accidental hosts like rodents, birds, dogs, etc. Not only does it have multiple hosts, but the eggs can survive for years in the soil. The eggs come in a very high output as well. It is also a highly pathogenic larval migration in accidental hosts. This is just one example of complex transmission and multiple reservoir species. There is also non random and limited sampling. Surveillance and wildlife management often relies on opportunistic samples. As we talked about in class with the deer population, hunters are biased with the land they hunt on, leading to the killing of specific deer demographics. This can skew surveillance and lead to the possibility of missing infections in the population.
