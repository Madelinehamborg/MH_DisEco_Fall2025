This is a picture of a disease ecology triangle. It shows the relationship between host, pathogen and environment. So far we have seen how each of these ideas come together and represent disease ecology. The host can contain a pathogen which also is impacted by environment. That being said, the environment can impact characteristics of the pathogen and also the host. They all come together to represent a cohesive understanding of disease.

Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

59

Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

299 samples

\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

228 samples

You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%

a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)

6/12/25=>New cases:5 so susceptible= 56-1-4=51

incidence: 5/51=0.098=9.8% per day

6/14/25=> New cases:2 so susceptible=56-12=44

Incidence:2/44= 0.0455=4.6% per day

6/15/25=>New cases: 0 So susceptible=56-14=42

Incidence=0/42=0% per day

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 6/13/25 and 6/16/25? What is the unit for prevelance

6/13/25=> 12/56=0.214=21.4%

6/16/25=> 5/56=0.089=8.9%

The unit for incidence is % of population at a point in time.

The unit of prevelance is a percentage of infected/whole population.

1.	MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (3 points)
FALSE. It is not primarily contained in humans. Its reservoir host is camels.  Human-Human transmission can occur when in close contact. According to the evidence, there isn’t sustained transmission in human species. 
2.	Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. It is in camels in the middle east/Africa, and the virus circulates through them. It can sometimes spillover to humans, but it is the camels that are the main reservoirs. Camels maintain the virus in the population for an elongated period of time.
3.	Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (3 points)
TRUE. Humans are dead end hosts because the transmission is limited and is not sustained within the population. Although secondary infection/transmission and spill over occur, it isn’t sustained.
4.	The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (3 points)
FALSE. The information above says 35% of reported MERS cases have died, not 65%. Case fatality corresponds to the amount of people who die specifically from a disease.
5.	The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. (3 points)
FALSE. There are multiple peaks over time. This means outbreaks are not from a single source point and can come from various environments such as sporadic areas or health care. Based on the look of the graph, it could represent a zoonotic spillover event. It could also be from multiple exposure events, and not just single exposure.

6.	Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend.    (5 points)
There are many factors that could cause this decline. Ecologically, there could be a reduction in contact between humans and infected camel. The decreased contact can be from travel, movement/trade of camel, or changes in travel trends. Behaviorally, there may have been changes due to the COVID-19 strain. People started taking precautions such as mask-wearing, increased sanitation, and human-human isolation. There was also a decrease in trave due to the bans many countries/areas put on. Epidemiologically, health care systems worked to prevent secondary outbreaks. There was also a rise in infection control awareness.

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwandaprobably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruitbats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases ofMarburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were healthcare workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

The Marburg Virus would be considered a spillover event under this frame work. According to the framework, disease emergence is a continuum. This means a spillover event from wildlife can become a human transmission/sustained event. We have seen in the past that direct exposure to bats can lead to human infection. With Egyptian fruit bats, human infection occurs from direct exposure of bat secretion or primates. This means there is limited human to human transmission. It is self-limiting and therefore does not promote human infection from pathogens that adapt. Overall, I would classify this as a zoonotic spillover instead of infectious disease emergence. If it was emergence of infectious disease, we would need to see sustained human-to-human transmission in the human population.

2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings? 5 pointsRecommended reading: Marburg Virus Disease in Rwanda – Centering Both Evidenceand Equity by Cameron T. Nutt (Canvas > Files > Readings)

There are many measures that can be implemented to reduce transmission. Early identification and isolation can be extremely beneficial. By reporting cases early and going into immediate isolation, it can reduce the spread. Another example would be to promote practices where there is safe burial/handling of fluids which can contain the spread within a community. Public and community education can also help raise awareness. By spreading information on awareness and prevention, numbers of cases can die down. An example of this would be to education communities on where the wildlife is that causes/transmits the disease. There can also be infectious control/training protocols in healthcare setting that can aid those with the infection. Even just by training, monitoring, isolating, and having good hygeine in the healthcare setting, a population could see a decreased risk of transmission.

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventative measures recommended by each setting. 

The transmission and prevention are different in Malaysia and Bangladesh. In Malaysia, the mode of transmission is typically through pigs. Specifically, fruitbats contaminated the pigs which were then given to humans. Human infection was due to contact with the pigs, so it was seen in a lot of farmers. It was also found that human-to-human transmission was very minimal and basically nonexistent. For prevention in Malaysia, they looked at interrupting the bat->pig-> human transmission chain. They focused on pig biosecurity. Some examples include moving fruit trees away from pig stables so the pig feed would not be contaminated by the bats. Also things like PPE, hygiene, and surveillance was done to help prevent more cases. In this situation, it is helpful for prevention to be at the livestock level since pigs are the major host. 

In Bangladesh, the primary route of transmission was from fruitbats to humans in a spillover event. The carrier of the disease was date palm sap that was contaminated by bats and sequentially consumed by humans. It then became frequent for human to human transmission. It was found in respiratory droplets, making it human to human. For the prevention of this disease, they looked at stopping the transmission of bats to humans and human to human. They used bamboo skirts to prevent the bat from interacting/licking the sap and contaminating it. They made public health announcements about consuming raw palm sap. There was also emphasis placed on hygiene and PPE for caregivers/healthcare and also isolation of people with the disease. In this situation, it is important for preventative measures to be taken for contaminated foods and human contact because the spillover is directly from bats and there is a lot of human to human transmission.

Avian reovirus (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristic supports one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly its impact on the affected population.

There are a few routes of transmission for ARV. For horizontal transmission, there is fecal-oral route, respiratory transmission, direct contact, and fomites. There is also an example of vertical transmission: Breeder hens that become infected can pass it directly to embryos. Although these are all possible for transmission, certain environments favor different types of transmission. With fecal-oral transmission, the virus survives and thrives in areas of poor sanitation and organic load. In general moist and cool environments are helpful for most of the modes of transmission. For fecal-oral and respiratory, environments like overcrowding and high population are good for the virus to spread. Also with the respiratory, poor ventilation promotes transmission. There are also pathogen characteristics that support transmission. This virus is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus. This virus is stable in the environment and is resistant to a lot of extremes due to its non enveloped character. This can help with fecal-oral transmission because it allows the virus to live in harsh conditions and live a long time outside of the primary host. An example of a wild bird disease caused by AVR is tenosynovitis in turkeys. This disease can cause inflammation, swollen joints, reduced mobility, and lameness.

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spill over and not a potential EID?

Based on what we know, the likely reservoir is shrew. The evidence that backed this claim up included high LayV detection in the shrews in comparison to other animals. Not only was it detected, but it was able to circulate the virus in nature. The likely mode of transmission is a zoonotic spillover from shrews to humans. This could have occurred through direct contact, indirect contact (fecal/urine/saliva), and possible contamination of food or other surfaces. There are many reasons as to why layV is not considered a potential EID. For one, there is no ongoing human-human transmission and all detected cases were considered sporadic. Not only this, but the amount of cases is very low and found in small rural areas. There is a small number of cases and there was also no evidence found of increasing cases or incidence. Since there are no sustained modes/chains of transmission with humans and human infection only occurs when in contact with the natural reservoir, one can assume this is a spillover.
