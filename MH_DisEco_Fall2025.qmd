Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

This is a picture of a disease ecology triangle. It shows the relationship between host, pathogen and environment. So far we have seen how each of these ideas come together and represent disease ecology. The host can contain a pathogen which also is impacted by environment. That being said, the environment can impact characteristics of the pathogen and also the host. They all come together to represent a cohesive understanding of disease.

Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

59

Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

299 samples

\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

228 samples

You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%

10/07/2025-- Try 2
a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)

6/12/25=>New cases:5 so susceptible= 56-1-4=51

incidence: 5/51=0.098=9.8% per day

6/14/25=> New cases:2 so susceptible=56-12=44

Incidence:2/44= 0.0455=4.6% per day

6/15/25=>New cases: 0 So susceptible=56-14=42

Incidence=0/42=0% per day

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 6/13/25 and 6/16/25? What is the unit for prevelance

6/13/25=> 12/56=0.214=21.4%

6/16/25=> 5/56=0.089=8.9%

The unit for incidence is % of population at a point in time.

The unit of prevelance is a percentage of infected/whole population.

C) On which day is the prevalence same as incidence (except the units)?

1/56=17.9% and 1/56=17.9% on 6/10/2025

d) On which day is incidence lowest?

6/15 and 6/16

6/15/25: 0/42=0 new cases

6/16/25=0/42 new cases
